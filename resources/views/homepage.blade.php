<h1>ABOUT US</h1>
<P class="pt-4">Aradhana tailors was founded in 2003 by two young entrepreneurs with an idea to sell custom tailored dress online. With their knowledge of modern IT technology and design they started this website, take measurements and made suits. Since then the company has grown significantly and today owns and operates its own manufacturing with a focus on high quality and social responsibility.</P>
<p>Finding your perfect fit is the first step to feeling and looking great. Its more than a matter of measurements. We believe a truly perfect fit garment is one that compliments you in every way. Thatâ€™s why we encourage our customers to personalise their made-to-measure clothes in our easy-to-use design tool. </p>
